          <p>When severed a plate of food most people wouldn't think of where it came from. Most don't think about  the torture that the animal that they are eating suffered. They don't even think twice about how animal was raised or wether it was in good living conditions. Factory farming is an industrial process in which animals and the products they generate are mass produced. Factory farming has seen a big spike in last 25 years. With the immense population growth, the demand for white and red meat has been on the rise. 99% of Farm animals in the United Sates are raised on factory farms.

          </center>Because factory farming is a business, ultimate goal is to maximize production and as a result make a profit. The animals on these farms are not seen individual, sentient beings with unique physical and psychological needs but as something that can be bred, fed, confined, and drugged to lay more eggs, birth more offspring, and die with more meat on their bones. A 2009 survey showed that 90% of Americans eat on average of 264.99 pounds of meat per year. And 75% of those people are completely oblivious to how their food got to their table.

   Racing Extinction :</div>
<div> -This Documentary is mostly about animals that are going extinct at a rapid pace, but those animals are treated very poorly
  <div> Ex. Rhinos in Africa </div>
  <div>1. The Horns of Rhinos contain Ivory. Because they have been illegally hunted down they have been put on the engendered animal list. The hunters are only interested in the horns, so when they remove the horns the Rhinos either bleed to death or develop issues with eating. </div>
